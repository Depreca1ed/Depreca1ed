# Hello there,
My name is Dep. I'm a 16 year old hobby developer. All projects in I have done so far are limited to Discord. I strive to grow further and work within the environment of bigger projects outside of what I have already done.

## Projects
> [!NOTE]
> All of my projects that I currently work on or have worked on are privated, although almost all of them are usable by everyone, unless stated otherwise. <3
